<span class="markdown">
This first version of the ontology contains a list of 16 typical representatives of wood-destroying insects occurring in Germany. Also some insects were included, which do not actively attack buildings, because they are only fresh wood insects. Nevertheless, it can sometimes happen that these insects hatch in timber that has been used for construction purposes, making it necessary for an expert to specify them. The insects are modeled as individuals and were classified according to the described classes. The environmental conditions and especially the humidity of the installed wood were modeled according to DIN 68-800 in the corresponding danger classes. In the differentiation of the affected wood types, a classification into hardwood and softwood was made. Afterwards the wood was subdivided into sapwood and heartwood, as the affection of the pests can also be classified into sapwood or heartwood destroyers. In softwood, the wood of Douglas fir, spruce, larch, fir and pine and in hardwood, the wood of beech, copper beech, birch, oak, ash, alder and chestnut were modeled. The flyholes of the insects can be divided by the shape and specific size. The shape is either round or oval, moreover, the edges of the flyholes can be smooth or fringed. The feces, i.e. the excrement of the insects, can be divided into cylinder form, round form and fine/dusty. The excrement balls are either angular or cylindrical.  The end of the excrement balls can be either sharp or rounded. If beetles are found on the site, they can still be described with color, size and special features.
