<h2>Abstract</h2><span class="markdown">
An essential part of maintenance in existing buildings is assessment and evaluation of structural condition by experts and specialists from different fields. Especially before renovation processes the assessment of an existing building is often significant for the further proceedings. Generating an assessment is characterized by heterogeneous influences and the detection, classification, evaluation and documentation of anomalies and damages include a high workload in the pre-project phase. On the one hand, costs and time for building assessment should be kept lean and on the other hand the findings must be reliable for the further planning of rehabilitation-/renovation processes. This paper is about the typical characteristics and classification of damaged timber structures in existing buildings. Therefore, this paper presents an approach of a domain ontology for the classification of wood pests. The implementation of a linked data ontology will assist the assessment engineer and transform his results to a more transparent structure. The long-term goal is to relieve and support the assessment engineer on the site and improve repetitive processes in assessment tasks.</span>
