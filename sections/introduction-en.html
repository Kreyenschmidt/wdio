The approach in this ontology is directed towards the integration of a domain ontology for damage assessment in wooden structures. Currently, only wood-destroying insects are mapped, which are accountable for about 30% of all damages in timber construction in Germany. The ontology shall support the expert in describing and documenting damages. In addition, the reasoner engine is to perform a classification that assists the identification of the pests. Furthermore, it is planned to link the ontology with other common ontologies to enhance the information content. The ontology for now shall be limited for the classification of wood destroying insects in Germany, representing the main species listed in literature.</span>
